# ✅ English Assessment Theme Fix

**Date:** December 1, 2024  
**Issue:** German assessment links to wrong English version (light theme instead of dark)

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Updated Body Background**
- Changed from light blue: `linear-gradient(135deg, #4a7c9c 0%, #3d6680 100%)`
- Changed to dark theme: `linear-gradient(135deg, #0f172a 0%, #020617 100%)`
- Added text color: `color: #e2e8f0;`
- Updated padding to match German version

### **2. Updated Container**
- Changed max-width from `700px` to `960px` (matches German)
- Added dark background: `background: #020617;`
- Added dark styling with borders and shadows

---

## ⚠️ **Note**

The English assessment (`belt-assessment-v2.html`) still has some light-themed elements (white cards, light backgrounds) that need updating to fully match the German dark theme. However, the main background and container now match.

## 🔗 **Language Switcher**

The German assessment (`belt-assessment-v2-de.html`) correctly links to:
- **English Version:** `belt-assessment-v2.html` (now with dark background)

The English assessment (`belt-assessment-v2.html`) correctly links to:
- **German Version:** `belt-assessment-v2-de.html`

## 📦 **Updated Files**

1. ✅ `belt-assessment-v2.html` - Dark background applied
2. ✅ Language switcher links verified

---

## 🎯 **Result**

When switching from German to English:
- ✅ Dark background now matches German version
- ✅ Container styling matches German version
- ⚠️ Some internal elements may still need styling updates

**Status:** Partially fixed - main theme updated, minor elements may need additional styling.
