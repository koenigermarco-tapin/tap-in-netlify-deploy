## ✅ BELT-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENTS (Unchanged):

The following files correctly reference their specific assessment files (NOT v2):
- ✅ `purple-belt-stripe4-carousel-NEW.html` → `purple-belt-assessment.html`
- ✅ `blue-belt-stripe4-carousel-NEW.html` → `blue-belt-assessment.html`

- `blue-belt-assessment.html`
- `purple-belt-assessment.html`
- `brown-belt-assessment.html`
