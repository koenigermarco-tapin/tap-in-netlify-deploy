### Message 2: Day 1 (24 Hours Later)

```
Subject: Your Champion Roadmap 🗺️

[First Name],

I spent time reviewing your profile. Here's what I see:

YOUR SITUATION:
→ Current role: [Role]
→ Team/org: [Context]
→ Main challenge: [Challenge]
→ Aspiration: [Goal]

YOUR UNFAIR ADVANTAGE:
→ [Something unique about them from sign-up]

YOUR 90-DAY CHAMPION PLAN:

MONTH 1: Foundation
→ Complete White + Blue Belts
→ Define your coaching niche
→ Build your workshop framework
→ Weekly calls: Deep dive on your challenges

MONTH 2: Acceleration
→ Complete Purple + Brown Belts
→ Shadow me in 2 workshops
→ Start building your client list
→ Weekly calls: Workshop prep + practice

MONTH 3: Launch
→ Complete Black Belt
→ Co-facilitate 1 workshop with me
→ Run your first solo workshop
→ Weekly calls: Debrief + optimization

REVENUE PROJECTION:
By end of Month 3, you should be able to book 2 workshops/month at €3,000 each.

That's €6,000/month GROSS.
Minus 30% to Tap-In = €4,200/month to you.

ROI: €4,200/month - €199/month = €4,001/month profit.

That's 20x return on your investment. PER MONTH.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Book our first 1:1 (if you haven't)
2. Text me your biggest question right now
3. Complete White Belt Module 1 this week

Let's build something extraordinary together.

## 📧 GENERAL TEMPLATES (Use When Needed)

### Upgrade Invitation (Challenger → Contender)

```
Subject: Ready to accelerate? 🚀

Hey [First Name],

I've been watching your progress. You're doing great.

Quick question: Want to go faster?

Contender tier includes:
→ Bi-weekly 1:1 coaching (vs. group only)
→ Accountability partner matching
→ Facilitator track access
→ Priority support (24-hour response)

Cost: $79/month (vs. your current $29)
Upgrade: [Link]

If you're happy at Challenger, no pressure. Keep crushing it.

But if you want to accelerate, Contender is the move.

Marco
```

### Upgrade Invitation (Contender → Champion)

```
Subject: Next level? 🥇

[First Name],

You're killing it at Contender level.

I think you're ready for Champion tier.

Here's why:

→ You've completed [X] belts (fast pace)
→ You're engaged in the community
→ You're showing up to coaching
→ You're applying what you learn

Champion tier would give you:
→ Weekly 1:1 with me (vs. bi-weekly)
→ Direct WhatsApp/Slack access
→ Facilitator certification (earn revenue)
→ Annual retreat invitation
→ Lifetime access (even if you cancel)

Cost: $199/month (vs. your current $79)

But here's the thing: Champion tier pays for itself.

Once certified, you'll earn 30% revenue share on workshops you run. One workshop/month = $900 to you. That's 4.5x your investment.

Want to chat about it? Reply here or book a call.

### Re-Engagement (Inactive Member)

If you want to pause or cancel, no hard feelings. But if you want to get back on track, I'm here.

Marco
```

### Cancellation Feedback Request

```
Subject: Sorry to see you go 😔

[First Name],

I saw you cancelled your membership.

No hard feelings, but I'd love to know why.

Was it:
→ Not enough value for the price?
→ Didn't have time to engage?
→ Didn't get the results you wanted?

Your honest feedback helps me make Tap-In Gym better for everyone.
