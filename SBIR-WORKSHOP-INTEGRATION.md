## 🎯 OVERVIEW

### How SBIR Games Support the 5 Dysfunctions Journey

The SBIR Feedback Sparring Games are designed to build the specific skills needed at each belt level, progressing through Lencioni's 5 Dysfunctions of a Team in reverse order (from foundation to peak):

```
🥋 WHITE BELT    → Absence of Trust (Vulnerability-Based Trust)
🥋 BLUE BELT     → Fear of Conflict (Productive Conflict)
🥋 PURPLE BELT   → Lack of Commitment (Buy-In & Clarity)
🥋 BROWN BELT    → Avoidance of Accountability (Peer Accountability)
🥋 BLACK BELT    → Inattention to Results (Collective Results via Teaching)
```

### Integration Philosophy:

**Games are not standalone activities** - they are skill-building drills integrated into the comprehensive belt curriculum:

- ✅ **Reinforce assessment learnings** - Apply concepts from belt assessments
- ✅ **Provide safe practice** - Low-stakes environment for high-stakes skills
- ✅ **Build muscle memory** - Repetition creates automaticity
- ✅ **Create community** - Shared experience builds team cohesion
- ✅ **Make learning sticky** - Play creates memorable moments

### When to Use SBIR Games:

| Context | Frequency | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Belt Training Programs | Weekly | Skill progression |
| Team Retreats | 1-2 sessions | Intensive practice |
| Leadership Workshops | Half-day | Foundational learning |
| Executive Coaching | Monthly | Accountability maintenance |
| Onboarding | Once per new cohort | Culture building |
| Refresher Training | Quarterly | Skill maintenance |

## 🥋 WHITE BELT INTEGRATION

### Dysfunction Focus: Absence of Trust (Vulnerability-Based Trust)

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING BY BELT LEVEL

### White Belt Common Issues:

**Issue: "I don't know what Impact to state"**
- **Cause:** Hasn't reflected on how behavior affected them
- **Solution:** Pre-game exercise: Write 3 behaviors that affected you this week and name the impact

**Issue: Keeps using "you always" despite knowing it's forbidden**
- **Cause:** Habit pattern, not intentional
- **Solution:** Immediate catch and correction. Make them redeliver immediately.

**Issue: SBIR feels robotic/scripted**
- **Cause:** Too focused on format, not enough on authenticity
- **Solution:** "It's supposed to feel awkward at first. Authenticity comes with repetition."

---

### Blue Belt Common Issues:

**Issue: Gives up when receiver pushes back**
- **Cause:** Conflict avoidance, fear of damaging relationship
- **Solution:** Reframe: "Avoiding conflict damages the relationship more than engaging in it."

**Issue: Becomes vague when pressured**
- **Cause:** Discomfort with being direct
- **Solution:** Practice specificity drills. "Tell me the exact date and time."

**Issue: Reverts to Tier 1 violations under stress**
- **Cause:** Pressure reveals default patterns
- **Solution:** Slow down. Take a breath. Re-start the sentence.

---

### Purple Belt Common Issues:

**Issue: Abandons cards when difficulty increases**
- **Cause:** Low tolerance for sustained challenge
- **Solution:** Escalation Ladder with support. "The point is to push through."

**Issue: Requests lack specificity**
- **Cause:** Doesn't think through actionability
- **Solution:** "Who does what by when?" forced framework

**Issue: Gets explicit "yes" but person doesn't follow through**
- **Cause:** Didn't create real buy-in, just compliance
- **Solution:** "What would get in the way of you doing this?" Pre-mortem the commitment.

---

### Brown Belt Common Issues:

**Issue: Too direct in high-context cultures, too indirect in low-context**
- **Cause:** Doesn't read cultural cues
- **Solution:** Culture Clash game + discussion of directness continuum

**Issue: Can't hold boss accountable (upward SBIR)**
- **Cause:** Fear of retaliation or damaging career
- **Solution:** Acknowledge legitimate risk. Practice "Request for conversation" approach.

**Issue: Defensive when receiving accountability**
- **Cause:** Easier to give than receive
- **Solution:** Reverse Feedback game. Model receiving well.

---

### Black Belt Common Issues:

**Issue: Can perform but can't teach**
- **Cause:** Unconscious competence - doesn't remember what it's like to not know
- **Solution:** Observe White Belt struggles. Remember your journey.

**Issue: Impatient with learners**
- **Cause:** High standards, forgets learning takes time
- **Solution:** "Your job is to create the conditions for learning, not to BE the learning."

**Issue: Team doesn't sustain SBIR culture without facilitator present**
- **Cause:** Hasn't embedded practices in systems
- **Solution:** Create rituals. "Start every 1-on-1 with 'Any SBIR for me?'"

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

The SBIR Feedback Sparring Games are not just activities - they're **deliberate practice tools** integrated into a comprehensive leadership development system.

**Key Integration Principles:**
1. **Align to dysfunction:** Each belt level addresses a specific Lencioni dysfunction
2. **Progress systematically:** Master one tier before adding the next
3. **Practice with purpose:** Every game session has clear learning objectives
4. **Apply in real work:** Transfer from games to actual team interactions
5. **Teach to master:** Black Belts solidify learning by teaching others

**The Ultimate Goal:**
Create teams where feedback is:
- ✅ Expected (not surprising)
- ✅ Welcomed (not feared)
- ✅ Specific (not vague)
- ✅ Regular (not rare)
- ✅ Reciprocal (everyone gives and receives)
- ✅ Impactful (drives real improvement)

**When SBIR becomes the team's default feedback method, the 5 Dysfunctions dissolve:**
- Trust builds through vulnerability
- Conflict becomes productive
- Commitments are clear and kept
- Accountability is peer-to-peer
- Results improve collectively

**Now go build high-performing teams through the power of practiced feedback!** 🥋
