# 🔧 CAROUSEL FIX - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**Issue:** Marco can't see interactive content in White Belt Stripe 1  
**Root Cause:** Navigator linking to WRONG files  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## ❌ THE PROBLEM

### Wrong File Links in Navigator:
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
1: 'white-belt-stripe1-interactive-FULL.html',  // ❌ 131 lines, stub file
2: 'white-belt-stripe2-interactive-FULL.html',  // ❌ Incomplete
3: 'white-belt-stripe3-interactive-FULL.html',  // ❌ Incomplete  
4: 'white-belt-stripe4-interactive-FULL.html',  // ❌ Incomplete
```

### Correct Files (With Full Content):
```javascript
// AFTER (CORRECT):
1: 'white-belt-stripe1-gamified.html',  // ✅ 1,170 lines, FULL content
2: 'white-belt-stripe2-gamified.html',  // ✅ 1,215 lines, FULL content
3: 'white-belt-stripe3-gamified.html',  // ✅ 1,259 lines, FULL content
4: 'white-belt-stripe4-gamified.html',  // ✅ 1,329 lines, FULL content
```

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED

**Updated:** `stripe-navigator.html`

Changed White Belt links from `-interactive-FULL.html` (stubs) to `-gamified.html` (full content).
