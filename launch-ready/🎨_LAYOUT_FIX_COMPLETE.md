## 📊 BEFORE / AFTER

### BEFORE (WRONG):

**The Hub:**
```
🚀 Leadership Development Hub  ← Too flashy
Master energy, boundaries...   ← Too sales-y

Stats: XP | Streak | Badges | Current Belt  ← Belt stats!
                               ↑
                          SHOULDN'T BE HERE

Learning Modules:              ← Should be "Paths"
- Energy Management  🔵 Blue Belt  ← Belt badge!
- Boundaries  🟣 Purple Belt       ← Belt badge!
  
... [Belt System Section with all 5 belts] ← WRONG!
```

### AFTER (CORRECT):

**The Hub:**
```
🏢 THE HUB                     ← Simple, professional
Professional Development & Team Tools  ← Clear purpose

Stats: XP | Streak | Badges | Paths Complete  ← No belt stats
                               ↑
                          CORRECT

Learning Paths:                ← Professional language
- Energy Management            ← No belt badges
  Sustainable performance systems
- Boundaries
  Healthy limits & priorities
  
[Gym Nudge Card]               ← Link to Gym for belts
```

## 🎯 CLEAR SEPARATION NOW

### THE GYM (gym-home-FOCUSED.html):
- **Focus:** Belt progression only
- **Content:** 20 stripes across 5 belts
- **Aesthetic:** Dark dojo (#0a0e1a)
- **Language:** Training, stripes, belt journey
- **Nudge:** "Earn bonus XP in The Hub"

### THE HUB (learning-hub.html):
- **Focus:** Professional courses + team tools
- **Content:** 10 learning paths, assessments, games
- **Aesthetic:** Professional (#252940 - lighter)
