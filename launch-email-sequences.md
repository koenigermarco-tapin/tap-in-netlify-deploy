### EMAIL A1: "Launching Tap-In Gym" (Day 1)

**Subject:** I'm launching something (and I want you in first)

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

I'm about to launch Tap-In Gym—a leadership community I've been building for the past [X months].

You're on this list because you've either:
→ Asked me for leadership advice before
→ Worked with me on a workshop
→ Said "I need to level up my leadership"

**What is Tap-In Gym?**

It's the #1 community for leaders who are done with theory and ready for real transformation.

You progress through 5 martial arts belts (White → Black), mastering the skills that actually matter:
- Trust
- Conflict navigation
- Ownership
- Decision-making
- Leading others

Each belt = 4 weeks of daily practice + weekly coaching + accountability.

**Here's the offer:**

Normal pricing:
- Challenger: $29/month
- Contender: $79/month (includes 1:1 coaching)
- Champion: $199/month (direct access to me + facilitator certification)

**Founding member pricing (first 100 only):**
- 50% off for life
- $14.50 / $39.50 / $99.50 per month
- Lock in this rate forever

**Why I'm telling you first:**

Because you're in my inner circle. I want people I trust to shape this community.

If 50 people like you join, it'll be incredible. If 500 randos join, it'll be garbage.

**Ready to join?**

Use code: FOUNDING100 at checkout

**Not ready yet?**

No problem. I'm sending 2 more emails this week with more details. Unsubscribe anytime.

Thanks for reading.

Marco

P.S. - If you know someone who should be in this community, forward this email. They'll thank you.

### EMAIL A2: "What Makes This Different" (Day 3)

**Subject:** Leadership training that doesn't suck (here's why)

**Body:**

[First Name],

Most leadership training is terrible.

You sit in a room for 8 hours, take notes, feel inspired... then nothing changes.

**Why traditional training fails:**

1. **It's one-time** → You forget 90% in a week
2. **It's theoretical** → No practice = no skill building
3. **No accountability** → Easy to skip the hard work
4. **No community** → You're alone with your challenges

**Tap-In Gym is different:**

1. **Daily practice** → 10-15 min exercises every day for 20 weeks
2. **Applied learning** → Every exercise ties to your real work
3. **Built-in accountability** → Weekly coaching + community support
4. **Peer learning** → Learn from 100+ other leaders facing same challenges

**Here's what you actually get:**

🥋 **5 Belt Training Programs**
- White Belt: Self-awareness & emotional intelligence
- Blue Belt: Building trust & psychological safety
- Purple Belt: Conflict navigation & feedback
- Brown Belt: Ownership & accountability
- Black Belt: Leading others to lead themselves

🎮 **4 Multiplayer Leadership Games**
- Confession Poker (vulnerability practice)
- Conflict Cards (feedback with humor)
- Take the Back (ownership claiming)
- Disagree & Commit (decision-making)

💬 **Weekly Group Coaching** (Challengers)
- Live calls every Tuesday 6pm CET
- Real problems, real solutions
- Learn from others' challenges

📞 **1:1 Coaching** (Contenders/Champions)
- Bi-weekly or weekly private sessions
- Personalized training plans
- Direct accountability

📱 **Full App Access**
- iOS + Android
- Track your progress
- Daily reminders
- Offline mode

🎓 **Facilitator Certification** (Champions)
- Learn to run workshops
- 30% revenue share
- Co-branded materials
- Client referrals

**Founding member deal expires in 4 days:**

$14.50/month (Challenger)
$39.50/month (Contender)
$99.50/month (Champion)

Lock in 50% off for life: [Link + FOUNDING100 code]

**Still not convinced?**

Reply with your biggest objection. I'll answer personally.

Marco

P.S. - "Is this just another course?" No. It's a community + accountability system + daily practice. Courses sit on your hard drive. This gets used daily.

### EMAIL B2: "Meet 3 Leaders Who Joined" (Day 4)

**Subject:** Meet 3 people who joined Tap-In Gym

**Body:**

[First Name],

You're still using the free version of Tap-In.

That's cool. But I want to show you what you're missing.

**Meet 3 people who upgraded:**

---

**Sarah M. - Engineering Manager, Berlin**  
*Tier: Contender ($79/mo)*

"I was stuck at the free tier limit every day. Got frustrated, upgraded to Contender. Best decision.

The 1:1 coaching alone is worth it. Marco helped me navigate a conflict with my senior engineer that could've blown up. Now we're tighter than ever.

ROI: One crisis avoided = 10x the membership cost."

---

**Thomas K. - Head of L&D, Vienna**  
*Tier: Champion ($199/mo)*

"I joined as Champion because I wanted facilitator certification.

Now I run Tap-In workshops for clients. Earned €9,000 in 2 months (30% goes to Tap-In = €6,300 to me).

My membership pays for itself 30x over. Plus, direct access to Marco is priceless."

---

**Lisa R. - Product Lead, Zurich**  
*Tier: Challenger ($29/mo)*

"I'm not a 'community person' usually. But this is different.

Seeing other leaders struggle with the same stuff I do? Game-changer.

Plus the weekly coaching calls give me ideas I actually use Monday morning.

$29 is less than lunch. No-brainer."

---

**What they all said:**

"I wish I'd upgraded sooner."

**Want what they have?**

Join here: [Link]

7-day free trial. No credit card.

Marco

P.S. - Not ready? That's fine. Keep using the free version. But when you hit that daily limit again tomorrow, remember this email. :)

---

**Subject:** Try Tap-In Gym free for 7 days (no card required)

## 📨 SEQUENCE C: CORPORATE DECISION MAKER

**Target:** L&D leads, HR directors, CHROs at companies with 50+ employees  
**Goal:** Book demo call or sell team licenses  
**Timeline:** 14 days

### EMAIL C1: "Team Training That Actually Sticks" (Day 1)

**Subject:** Leadership training that doesn't disappear after 2 weeks

**Body:**

[First Name],

Quick question:

How much of your last leadership training stuck after 30 days?

If you're like most L&D leads, the answer is: not much.

**Why traditional training fails:**

→ One-time events (no reinforcement)
→ Passive learning (no practice)
→ No accountability (easy to forget)
→ Expensive ($5K-20K per person)

**What if there was a better way?**

**Tap-In Gym:**

A leadership community your team actually uses every day.

**How it works:**

1. **Daily practice** → 10-15 minute exercises (5 days/week)
2. **Weekly coaching** → Live group calls with expert facilitators
3. **Peer accountability** → Teams support each other
4. **Gamified progression** → 5 belts (White → Black) = clear milestones
5. **Continuous** → Not a course. A lifestyle.

**Results we're seeing:**

→ 87% daily engagement (vs. 12% for typical LMS)
→ 6-month retention rate: 82%
→ Managers report 3.2x improvement in conflict handling
→ Leadership pipeline: 2.3x more internal promotions

**Pricing for teams:**

- 5-10 people: $199/person/month
- 11-25 people: $149/person/month
- 26-50 people: $99/person/month
- 51+ people: Custom pricing

**Want to see it in action?**

No pitch. Just value.

### EMAIL C2: "Case Study - 22% → 9% Turnover" (Day 5)

**Subject:** How [Company] cut turnover in half with Tap-In

**Body:**

[First Name],

Remember that email about training that actually sticks?

Here's proof it works.

**Case Study: TechCorp GmbH**

**Company:** 150-person tech company, Berlin  
**Challenge:** 22% annual turnover (mostly mid-level managers)  
**Root cause:** "Managers promoted for technical skills, not leadership skills"

**What they tried before:**
- External leadership training ($8K/person) → No lasting impact
- Executive coaching (5 managers) → Too expensive to scale
- Internal mentorship program → Inconsistent quality

**What they did with Tap-In:**

**Month 1:** Enrolled 15 mid-level managers (Contender tier)
→ Daily exercises (avg 87% completion rate)
→ Weekly group coaching
→ Accountability partner system

**Month 2:** Added 25 senior ICs (Challenger tier)
→ Building leadership skills before promotion
→ Preparing for management transitions

**Month 3:** Launched facilitator program
→ Certified 3 internal leaders
→ Now run workshops for new hires

**Results after 6 months:**

→ **Turnover: 22% → 9%** (saved ~€480K in recruitment costs)
→ **Internal promotions: +127%** (11 promotions vs. 5 previous 6 months)
→ **Engagement scores: +31%** (manager effectiveness rating)
→ **Training cost per person: €1,188/year** (vs. €8,000 for external training)

**ROI:** 4.7x in year 1

**What their L&D lead said:**

"We tried everything. The difference with Tap-In is daily engagement. Our managers actually use it. Every. Single. Day. That's never happened before."

— Anna S., Head of Learning & Development

### EMAIL C3: "Group Rates for Teams" (Day 10)

**Subject:** Special group pricing for [Company Name]

**Body:**

[First Name],

You didn't respond to my last 2 emails, so this is my final one.

I wanted to share our team pricing before moving on.

**Standard Individual Pricing:**
- Challenger: $29/person/month
- Contender: $79/person/month
- Champion: $199/person/month

**Team Pricing (10+ people):**

| Team Size | Price/Person/Month | Annual Savings |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 10-25     | $149              | 30% off        |
| 26-50     | $99               | 50% off        |
| 51-100    | $79               | 60% off        |
| 100+      | Custom            | Let's talk     |

**What's included in team packages:**

✅ Unlimited app access for all members
✅ Weekly group coaching (dedicated to your org)
✅ Custom facilitator certification (train internal coaches)
✅ Admin dashboard (track engagement, progress, ROI)
✅ Quarterly business reviews (optimize program together)
✅ Priority support (dedicated account manager)

**Example: 30-person leadership team**

**Cost:**
30 people × $99/month × 12 months = $35,640/year

**Traditional alternative:**
30 people × $8,000 external training = $240,000

**Savings:** $204,360 (85% less)

**Expected ROI based on similar orgs:**
- Turnover reduction: 15-30% → Save $200K-500K/year
- Internal promotion rate: +50-100% → Save $100K-300K in external hires
- Productivity gains: 10-20% → Hard to quantify but significant

**Break-even:** Month 1-2 (just from reduced turnover)

**Want to explore this?**

Or reply with your team size and I'll send a custom proposal.

## 🔄 FOLLOW-UP SCRIPTS

**If they reply "Not now":**

"No worries! Mind if I ask why? (Just trying to improve)

And if timing is the only issue, want me to ping you in [3/6/12] months?"

---

**If they reply "Too expensive":**

"Totally fair. Quick question: What would make it worth $[price]/month for you?

Also, what's your monthly coffee budget? (Not being snarky—genuinely curious how you think about ROI)"

---

**If they reply "Already doing leadership training":**

"That's great! What are you using?

And how's the engagement? (Most programs we replace have <20% usage after week 2)

Happy to show you Tap-In as a comparison. No pressure."

---

**If they don't reply after 3 emails:**

"[First Name] - I'll stop bugging you after this :)

Just wanted to make sure you saw the founding member offer (50% off for life).

If you're interested, it's here: [Link]

If not, no worries! I'll remove you from this sequence.

Either way, thanks for reading.

Marco"

## 📝 FINAL NOTES

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Send between 9-11am in recipient's timezone
- ✅ Personalize first line (reference past interaction)
- ✅ Keep under 300 words (people scan, don't read)
- ✅ One CTA per email (don't confuse them)
- ✅ Respond within 2 hours (strike while hot)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Sending on weekends (lower open rates)
- ❌ Generic "Dear Sir/Madam" (instant delete)
- ❌ Multiple CTAs (decision paralysis)
- ❌ Hype language ("LIMITED TIME!!!")
- ❌ Forgetting to test links (embarrassing)

**Remember:**
- Your warm network will convert best (5-10%)
- Free app users are hottest leads (10-15%)
- Corporate takes longer but pays more ($3K-30K deals)

**Start with Sequence A. Perfect it. Then scale to B and C.**
