## 📱 BROWSER COMPATIBILITY

Tested & Compatible:
- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+
- ✅ Mobile Safari (iOS 14+)
- ✅ Mobile Chrome (Android 10+)

**Note:** Language switcher requires JavaScript enabled.

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Language doesn't persist after navigation
**Solution:** Each page needs the language switcher component. Currently only on `index-DUAL-ENTRY.html`.

### Issue 2: "Take Assessment" link might 404
**Solution:** Ensure `team-assessment-enhanced-v2.html` exists in deployment. If not, update button to link to existing assessment file.

### Issue 3: Caching issues (users see old version)
**Solution:** The deployment already includes cache-busting meta tags and Netlify headers. Force refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac).
