## Template 1: To Your Professional Network

**Subject:** Try my new leadership game? (15 min test)

---

Hey [First Name],

Quick favor:

I just launched 4 multiplayer games for teams to practice giving feedback, handling conflict, and building trust.

Would you test one with your team and give me 2 minutes of feedback?

**Pick any game:**

🃏 **Confession Poker** (Build psychological safety)
Players rate their honesty, others guess → Vulnerability becomes points
👉 [LINK]

💼 **Conflict Cards** (Navigate workplace conflict)  
Cards Against Humanity format, but for difficult conversations
👉 [LINK]

🔥 **Take the Back** (Practice ownership)
First to claim a "broken thing" must explain how to fix it
👉 [LINK]

🎯 **Disagree & Commit** (Make hard decisions)
Debate controversial choices under time pressure
👉 [LINK]

**All you need:**
- 3+ people (teammates, friends, anyone)
- 20 minutes
- Phones or laptops

Works on single device (pass around) or multiple devices (room codes).

**After playing, just reply with:**
1. What worked? ✅
2. What broke? 🐛  
3. What confused you? 🤔

Thanks!
[Your Name]

P.S. These are 100% free. I'm just collecting feedback to make them better.

## Template 2: To L&D / HR Professionals

**Subject:** Free workshop games for psychological safety & feedback

---

Hi [First Name],

I know you're always looking for engaging training materials.

I just built something you might find useful:

**4 multiplayer games that make leadership development actually fun.**

They're designed to help teams practice:
→ Vulnerability & trust
→ Productive conflict
→ Ownership & accountability  
→ Decision-making under pressure

**How they work:**
- 3-8 players per game
- 20-40 minute sessions
- Mobile-friendly (works remote or in-person)
- No facilitation experience needed

**What makes them different:**
✅ Actually fun (not "corporate fun")
✅ Safe space to practice hard skills
✅ Memorable (people remember games, not lectures)
✅ Scalable (self-facilitated)

**Check them out:**
[LINKS TO ALL 4 GAMES]

**Want to use these in your programs?**

I'm building a facilitator toolkit with:
- Workshop integration guides
- Debrief question prompts
- Customizable scenarios
- Assessment rubrics

Reply if you'd like early access.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. I built these for Tap-In Leadership Development. They're free for now while I gather feedback from pros like you.
