═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    THE SBIR FRAMEWORK
              Situation • Behavior • Impact • Request
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 PURPOSE:
Deliver feedback that creates change, not defensiveness.
Build trust through vulnerability, not attack.

🔑 CORE PRINCIPLE:
Focus on observable behavior and its impact, not character 
judgments or assumptions about intent.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    S - SITUATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📍 WHAT: Set the context with specific time/place

✅ GOOD EXAMPLES:
• "In yesterday's 2pm standup meeting..."
• "Last Tuesday when we were discussing the Q3 budget..."
• "This morning at 9:15am in the shared kitchen..."
• "During the client call on November 15th..."
• "At dinner last Friday night..."

❌ BAD EXAMPLES:
• "Lately..." (too vague - when exactly?)
• "The other day..." (which day?)
• "In meetings..." (which meeting specifically?)
• "Sometimes..." (not specific enough)
• "You always..." (judgment, not situation)

🎯 SBIR TIP:
Include enough detail that the person can recall the 
specific moment. If they can't remember it, you haven't 
been specific enough.

TEST: Could you find this moment on a calendar?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    B - BEHAVIOR
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

👁️ WHAT: Describe what you saw/heard (observable only)

✅ GOOD EXAMPLES:
• "When you interrupted me 3 times during my presentation..."
• "When you sent that email at 11pm and marked it urgent..."
• "When you said 'that's a stupid idea' to Sarah..."
• "When you checked your phone 5 times in 10 minutes..."
• "When you left the wet towel on the bed..."

❌ BAD EXAMPLES:
• "Your attitude was negative..." (not observable)
• "You were being disrespectful..." (interpretation)
• "You didn't care about the deadline..." (assumes intent)
• "Your tone was aggressive..." (internal state)
• "You were lazy..." (character judgment)

🎯 SBIR TIP:
Use "When you [action]" not "You are [adjective]"

TEST: Could a camera capture this? If not, it's not behavior.

WHAT YOU CAN OBSERVE:
✓ Words spoken (exact quotes)
✓ Actions taken
✓ Facial expressions
✓ Body language
✓ Timing/frequency
✓ Written communication

WHAT YOU CAN'T OBSERVE:
✗ Intentions
✗ Feelings
✗ Thoughts
✗ Character traits
✗ Motivations

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    I - IMPACT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💥 WHAT: Explain the effect on you/team/results

✅ GOOD EXAMPLES:
• "...I felt disrespected and stopped sharing my ideas."
• "...the team missed the deadline and we lost the €50K contract."
• "...I spent 3 hours redoing work that was already complete."
• "...Sarah stayed quiet for the rest of the meeting."
• "...I had to rewash the bedding, which took 45 minutes."

❌ BAD EXAMPLES:
• "It was bad..." (not specific)
• "It bothered me..." (too vague)
• "You made me angry..." (blames them for your emotion)
• "Obviously this is a problem..." (assumes they know)
• "Everyone was upset..." (vague and assumes)

🎯 SBIR TIP:
Connect behavior to measurable outcomes:
• Time lost
• Money lost
• Relationships damaged
• Emotions experienced
• Results missed
• Trust broken

THREE TYPES OF IMPACT:

1️⃣ PERSONAL IMPACT (Your experience)
   "I felt excluded..."
   "I lost trust in..."
   "I experienced frustration..."

2️⃣ TEAM IMPACT (Group consequences)
   "The team fell behind schedule..."
   "Other members started avoiding meetings..."
   "Team morale decreased..."

3️⃣ BUSINESS IMPACT (Measurable results)
   "We missed the revenue target by €100K..."
   "The client complained to our CEO..."
   "We violated the compliance requirement..."

TEST: Can you quantify or clearly describe the consequence?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    R - REQUEST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 WHAT: State specific, actionable change you want

✅ GOOD EXAMPLES:
• "Going forward, I'd like you to check with me before 
   presenting my analysis."
• "In future meetings, would you let me finish my sentences?"
• "Could you put wet towels in the hamper after showering?"
• "I need you to send urgent emails only for true emergencies."
• "Would you be willing to arrive within 10 minutes of our 
   scheduled time?"

❌ BAD EXAMPLES:
• "Just be better..." (not specific)
• "Show more respect..." (too vague)
• "Don't do that again..." (doesn't say what to do instead)
• "Be more professional..." (undefined)
• "Work on your attitude..." (not actionable)

🎯 SBIR TIP:
Your request should be so specific that you could observe 
and measure compliance.

REQUEST QUALITY CHECKLIST:
□ Is it specific? (Not "be better")
□ Is it observable? (Can you see them do it?)
□ Is it reasonable? (Within their power to change)
□ Is it actionable? (Clear next step)
□ Is it respectful? (Request, not demand)

EXAMPLE REQUESTS BY CONTEXT:

📧 COMMUNICATION:
• "Please respond to client emails within 24 hours"
• "Send me a heads-up before making changes to my code"
• "Use Reply (not Reply All) unless everyone needs to see it"

⏰ TIME/ATTENDANCE:
• "Arrive to meetings within 5 minutes of start time"
• "Let me know by 5pm if you'll be late tomorrow"
• "Give 24-hour notice if you need to reschedule"

🤝 COLLABORATION:
• "Run major decisions by me before announcing them"
• "Credit team members when presenting their work"
• "Ask before using my desk supplies"

💬 MEETINGS:
• "Mute your mic when you're eating"
• "Let me complete my thought before responding"
• "Put your phone face-down during our 1-on-1s"

TEST: Could someone else observe whether they followed 
through on this request?

│     Berlin and we're moving in 60 days, that was the     │
│     first I was hearing about the job offer, the         │
│     decision, or the timeline."                          │
│                                                           │
│ I: "I felt excluded from a major life decision that      │

│     purchases over €5,000—I need us to discuss and       │
│     decide together before either of us commits or       │
│     announces publicly. Are you willing to do that?"     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLE 3 - HIGH-STAKES BUSINESS (Red Card Difficulty)
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SCENARIO: Executive misrepresents financial runway       │
│                                                           │

│ B: "...when you stated we have 6 months of runway, the   │

│ I: "This creates legal liability for both of us under    │
│     securities law. It also damages my trust in our      │
│     partnership because accurate financials are my core  │
│     responsibility. If investors discover the            │
│     discrepancy, we could lose the term sheet worth      │
│     €2M and face legal action."                          │

│     us to agree that all future financial statements to  │
│     investors will be reviewed by me before delivery."   │

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                  COMMON SBIR MISTAKES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ MISTAKE #1: Sandwich Approach
BAD: "You're great at X, but you're terrible at Y, but 
      overall you're good!"
WHY: Dilutes message. They remember the compliment, not 
     the feedback.
FIX: Deliver SBIR cleanly without padding.

❌ MISTAKE #2: Past-Focused Instead of Future-Focused
BAD: "You should have done X differently."
WHY: Can't change the past. Creates defensiveness.
FIX: "Going forward, I'd like you to do X."

❌ MISTAKE #3: Multiple Behaviors at Once
BAD: "You interrupt, arrive late, and don't respond to 
      emails..."
WHY: Overwhelming. Person doesn't know where to start.
FIX: Pick ONE behavior per SBIR conversation.

❌ MISTAKE #4: Assuming Intent
BAD: "You didn't care about the deadline..."
WHY: You don't know their internal motivation.
FIX: Describe observable behavior only.

❌ MISTAKE #5: Vague Impact
BAD: "It bothered me..."
WHY: Too general to understand severity.
FIX: "I spent 3 hours redoing work, missing my daughter's 
      recital."

❌ MISTAKE #6: Unclear Request
BAD: "Be more respectful..."
WHY: "Respect" means different things to different people.
FIX: "Use my preferred name (Sarah, not Sally) in meetings."

❌ MISTAKE #7: Demand Instead of Request
BAD: "You need to stop doing this."
WHY: Removes agency, creates power dynamic.
FIX: "Would you be willing to...?"

                  SBIR MASTERY LEVELS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🥋 WHITE BELT: Can deliver complete SBIR with Tier 1 
               forbidden words avoided (no blame language)

🥋 BLUE BELT: Delivers specific SBIR with measurable details
              (Tier 2 - no vague language)

🥋 PURPLE BELT: Maintains psychological safety while 
                delivering tough feedback (Tier 3 - no power 
                violations)

🥋 BROWN BELT: Delivers SBIR in high-stakes situations with 
               precision (Tier 4 - master level)

🥋 BLACK BELT: Teaches SBIR to others and coaches real-time 
               improvement

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                  RECEIVING FEEDBACK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SBIR works both ways! When someone gives YOU feedback:

1️⃣ LISTEN FULLY
   • Don't interrupt
   • Don't defend
   • Don't explain
   • Just receive

2️⃣ CLARIFY IF NEEDED
   • "Can you give me a specific example?"
   • "When exactly did this happen?"
   • "What specifically would you like me to do differently?"

3️⃣ ACKNOWLEDGE IMPACT
   • "I hear that this affected you by..."
   • "I understand this created X consequence..."
   • You don't have to agree with intent, just acknowledge 
     their experience

4️⃣ COMMIT OR NEGOTIATE
   • If reasonable: "I'll do that. Thank you for telling me."
   • If unreasonable: "I'm not willing to do that, but I 
     could do this instead..."
