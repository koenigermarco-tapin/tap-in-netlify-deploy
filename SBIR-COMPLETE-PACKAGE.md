```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "You always..."
❌ "You never..."
❌ "You're so..."
❌ "That's just who you are"
❌ "You don't care about..."

WHY: These generalize behavior into character traits, making the person feel attacked.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE: Focus on specific instances with dates/times. 
"When you..." not "You always..."
```

**Card #2: Character Judgments**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Lazy"
❌ "Careless"
❌ "Inconsiderate"
❌ "Selfish"
❌ "Thoughtless"

WHY: These are character judgments, not behavior descriptions. They trigger defensiveness.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE: Describe the specific action: "When you left the towel on the bed" 
not "You're so careless"
```

**Card #3: Invalidation Language**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Obviously..."
❌ "Clearly..."
❌ "Everyone knows..."
❌ "It's common sense..."
❌ "Anyone would..."

```

**Card #4: Moral Judgments**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Wrong"
❌ "Bad"
❌ "Stupid"
❌ "Ridiculous"
❌ "Unacceptable"

WHY: Moral judgments escalate conflict. The person defends themselves rather than 
hearing your concern.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE: Describe impact: "When this happened, I felt frustrated because..." 
not "That was wrong"
```

**Card #5: Rhetorical Questions**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Why would you...?"
❌ "Why did you...?"
❌ "What were you thinking?"
❌ "How could you...?"
❌ "Why can't you just...?"

WHY: Rhetorical questions disguised as feedback. They're accusations, not genuine questions.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE: Make a direct request: "Going forward, I'd like you to..." 
not "Why can't you just...?"
```

---

### 🔍 TIER 2: VAGUE LANGUAGE (5 Cards)

**Card #6: Frequency Vagueness**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Sometimes..."
❌ "Often..."

✓ "In the last 5 meetings"
✓ "Daily at 9am"
✓ "Every Monday for 6 weeks"
```

**Card #7: Internal State References**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Your attitude..."
❌ "Your tone..."
❌ "Your vibe..."
❌ "The way you..."
❌ "Your energy..."

✓ "When you rolled your eyes..."
✓ "When you interrupted 3 times..."
```

**Card #8: Example Vagueness**
```

SBIR REQUIREMENT: Must cite specific incident:
✓ "When you ate chips during the client call on Tuesday..."

```

**Card #9: Undefined Labels**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Inappropriate"
❌ "Unprofessional"
❌ "Disrespectful"
❌ "Rude"
❌ "Offensive"

WHY: Different people define these differently.

SBIR REQUIREMENT: Must describe the actual behavior:
✓ "When you made a joke about religion in the standup..."
✓ "When you called me by the wrong name in front of the CEO..."
```

**Card #10: Vague Requests**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "Better"
❌ "More"
❌ "Less"
❌ "Improve"

✓ "Mute your mic when eating"
```

**Card #11: Commands**
```
FORBIDDEN:
❌ "You need to..."
❌ "You have to..."
❌ "You must..."
❌ "You should..."
❌ "You better..."

WHY: Commands remove agency and create parent-child dynamic.

```

**Card #12: Emotional Responsibility**
```
FORBIDDEN:

```

```

❌ "Your problem is..."
❌ "What's wrong with you is..."
❌ "The issue with you..."

WHY: Frames the person as fundamentally broken.

SBIR REQUIREMENT: Focus on specific behavior impact:

```
FORBIDDEN (MASTER LEVEL):

```

**Card #17: Hedging Language**
```

❌ "Sort of..."

WHY: Hedging language undermines your message.

❌ "Sorry, but..."
❌ "I don't mean to..."
❌ "No offense, but..."
❌ "I hate to say this..."
❌ "Don't take this the wrong way..."

```

**Card #19: Minimizing Language**
```
FORBIDDEN (MASTER LEVEL):

## 📦 FILE 3: SBIR REFERENCE CARD

### THE SBIR FRAMEWORK

**S**ituation • **B**ehavior • **I**mpact • **R**equest

**Purpose:** Deliver feedback that creates change, not defensiveness. Build trust through vulnerability, not attack.

**Core Principle:** Focus on observable behavior and its impact, not character judgments or assumptions about intent.

---

### S - SITUATION

**What:** Set the context with specific time/place

**✅ Good Examples:**
- "In yesterday's 2pm standup meeting..."
- "Last Tuesday when we were discussing the Q3 budget..."
- "This morning at 9:15am in the shared kitchen..."
- "During the client call on November 15th..."

**❌ Bad Examples:**
- "Lately..." (too vague)
- "The other day..." (which day?)
- "In meetings..." (which meeting?)
- "You always..." (judgment, not situation)

**Test:** Could you find this moment on a calendar?

---

### B - BEHAVIOR

**What:** Describe what you saw/heard (observable only)

**✅ Good Examples:**
- "When you interrupted me 3 times during my presentation..."
- "When you sent that email at 11pm and marked it urgent..."
- "When you said 'that's a stupid idea' to Sarah..."
- "When you left the wet towel on the bed..."

**❌ Bad Examples:**
- "Your attitude was negative..." (not observable)
- "You were being disrespectful..." (interpretation)
- "You didn't care about the deadline..." (assumes intent)
- "You were lazy..." (character judgment)

**Test:** Could a camera capture this? If not, it's not behavior.

**What You Can Observe:**
- Words spoken (exact quotes)
- Actions taken
- Facial expressions
- Body language
- Timing/frequency

**What You Can't Observe:**
- Intentions
- Feelings
- Thoughts
- Character traits

---

### I - IMPACT

**What:** Explain the effect on you/team/results

**✅ Good Examples:**
- "...I felt disrespected and stopped sharing my ideas."
- "...the team missed the deadline and we lost the €50K contract."
- "...I spent 3 hours redoing work that was already complete."
- "...Sarah stayed quiet for the rest of the meeting."

**❌ Bad Examples:**
- "It was bad..." (not specific)
- "It bothered me..." (too vague)
- "You made me angry..." (blames them for your emotion)
- "Everyone was upset..." (vague and assumes)

**Three Types of Impact:**

1. **Personal Impact:** "I felt excluded..."
2. **Team Impact:** "The team fell behind schedule..."
3. **Business Impact:** "We missed the revenue target by €100K..."

**Test:** Can you quantify or clearly describe the consequence?

---

### R - REQUEST

**What:** State specific, actionable change you want

**✅ Good Examples:**
- "Going forward, I'd like you to check with me before presenting my analysis."
- "In future meetings, would you let me finish my sentences?"
- "Could you put wet towels in the hamper after showering?"
- "I need you to send urgent emails only for true emergencies."

**❌ Bad Examples:**
- "Just be better..." (not specific)
- "Show more respect..." (too vague)
- "Don't do that again..." (doesn't say what to do instead)
- "Be more professional..." (undefined)

**Request Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Is it specific?
- [ ] Is it observable?
- [ ] Is it reasonable?
- [ ] Is it actionable?
- [ ] Is it respectful?

**Test:** Could someone else observe whether they followed through?

---

### COMPLETE SBIR EXAMPLE

**Scenario:** Colleague takes credit for your work

**SBIR Delivery:**

**S:** "In Monday's client meeting at 10am..."

**B:** "...when you presented the pricing analysis and said 'I spent all weekend on this,' that was the analysis I sent you Friday with my name on it."

**I:** "I felt invisible and unvalued. I also lost confidence that my work will be recognized, which makes me less motivated to go above and beyond."

**R:** "Going forward, when you present analysis I've done, I'd like you to say 'Sarah provided this analysis' or include my name on the slides."
