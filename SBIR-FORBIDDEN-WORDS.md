## 20 FORBIDDEN WORD CARDS (4 Tiers)

---

## 🚫 TIER 1: BLAME LANGUAGE (5 Cards)
*Used with: GREEN cards*
*Focus: Eliminating character attacks and judgment*

### Forbidden Words Card #1
```
═══════════════════════════════
🚫 TIER 1 - BLAME LANGUAGE
CARD #1
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "You always..."
❌ "You never..."
❌ "You're so..."
❌ "That's just who you are"
❌ "You don't care about..."

WHY FORBIDDEN:
These generalize behavior into 
character traits, making the person 
feel attacked rather than addressing 
specific actions.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE:
Focus on specific instances with 
dates/times. "When you..." not 
"You always..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #2
```
═══════════════════════════════
🚫 TIER 1 - BLAME LANGUAGE
CARD #2
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Lazy"
❌ "Careless"
❌ "Inconsiderate"
❌ "Selfish"
❌ "Thoughtless"

WHY FORBIDDEN:
These are character judgments, not 
behavior descriptions. They trigger 
defensiveness and shut down dialogue.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE:
Describe the specific action: 
"When you left the towel on the bed" 
not "You're so careless"
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #3
```
═══════════════════════════════
🚫 TIER 1 - BLAME LANGUAGE
CARD #3
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Obviously..."
❌ "Clearly..."
❌ "Everyone knows..."
❌ "It's common sense..."
❌ "Anyone would..."

WHY FORBIDDEN:
These phrases invalidate the other 
person's perspective and imply they're 
stupid for not seeing things your way.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE:
State your observation: "I noticed..." 
or "From my perspective..." or 
"The impact I experienced was..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #4
```
═══════════════════════════════
🚫 TIER 1 - BLAME LANGUAGE
CARD #4
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Wrong"
❌ "Bad"
❌ "Stupid"
❌ "Ridiculous"
❌ "Unacceptable"

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Moral judgments escalate conflict. 
The person defends themselves rather 
than hearing your concern.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE:
Describe impact: "When this happened, 
I felt frustrated because..." not 
"That was wrong"
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #5
```
═══════════════════════════════
🚫 TIER 1 - BLAME LANGUAGE
CARD #5
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Why would you...?"
❌ "Why did you...?"
❌ "What were you thinking?"
❌ "How could you...?"
❌ "Why can't you just...?"

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Rhetorical questions disguised as 
feedback. They're accusations, not 
genuine questions seeking understanding.

SBIR ALTERNATIVE:
Make a direct request: "Going forward, 
I'd like you to..." not "Why can't you 
just...?"
═══════════════════════════════
```

CARD #6
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Sometimes..."
❌ "Often..."
❌ "Frequently..."
❌ "A lot..."
❌ "Lately..."

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Too vague to be actionable. The person 
can't identify the pattern or severity.

SBIR REQUIREMENT:
Must include specific frequency:
✓ "3 times this week"
✓ "In the last 5 meetings"
✓ "Daily at 9am"
✓ "Every Monday for 6 weeks"
═══════════════════════════════
```

CARD #7
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Your attitude..."
❌ "Your tone..."
❌ "Your vibe..."
❌ "The way you..."
❌ "Your energy..."

WHY FORBIDDEN:
These reference internal states you 
can't observe. Focus on observable 
behavior only.

SBIR REQUIREMENT:
Must describe specific observable 
actions:
✓ "When you said [exact words]..."
✓ "When you rolled your eyes..."
✓ "When you interrupted 3 times..."
═══════════════════════════════

```
═══════════════════════════════
🔍 TIER 2 - VAGUE LANGUAGE

───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Things like that"
❌ "Stuff like this"
❌ "That kind of behavior"
❌ "Similar situations"
❌ "These issues"

WHY FORBIDDEN:
No specific example means no clear 
path to change. Person doesn't know 
what to adjust.

SBIR REQUIREMENT:
Must cite specific incident:
✓ "When you ate chips during the 
    client call on Tuesday..."
✓ "In yesterday's 2pm meeting when..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #9
```
═══════════════════════════════
🔍 TIER 2 - VAGUE LANGUAGE
CARD #9
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Inappropriate"
❌ "Unprofessional"
❌ "Disrespectful"
❌ "Rude"
❌ "Offensive"

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Different people define these 
differently. What seems obvious to 
you may not be to them.

SBIR REQUIREMENT:
Must describe the actual behavior:
✓ "When you made a joke about religion 
    in the standup..."
✓ "When you called me by the wrong 
    name in front of the CEO..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #10
```
═══════════════════════════════
🔍 TIER 2 - VAGUE LANGUAGE
CARD #10
───────────────────────────────
FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "Better"
❌ "More"
❌ "Less"
❌ "Improve"
❌ "Work on"

WHY FORBIDDEN:
These don't define success criteria. 
"Be better" could mean anything.

SBIR REQUIREMENT:
Request must be specific and 
measurable:
✓ "Start the meeting within 2 minutes 
    of scheduled time"
✓ "Check with me before presenting my 
    analysis"
✓ "Mute your mic when eating"
═══════════════════════════════
```

## ⚡ TIER 3: POWER LANGUAGE VIOLATIONS (5 Cards)
*Used with: ORANGE cards*
*Focus: Maintaining safety and agency*

### Forbidden Words Card #11
```
═══════════════════════════════

FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "You need to..."
❌ "You have to..."
❌ "You must..."
❌ "You should..."
❌ "You better..."

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Commands remove agency and create 
parent-child dynamic. Even valid 
feedback sounds like an order.

✓ "Going forward, could you...?"
═══════════════════════════════
```

❌ "You made me..."
❌ "Because of you, I..."
❌ "You're responsible for my..."
❌ "You caused me to..."

emotions. Removes your ownership of 
your internal experience.

✓ "I felt excluded when..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

```
═══════════════════════════════
⚡ TIER 3 - POWER LANGUAGE

FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES:

❌ "If you don't..."
❌ "Unless you..."
❌ "Or else..."
❌ "I'll have to..."
❌ "Don't make me..."

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Threats shut down psychological 
safety. Person complies out of fear, 
not understanding.

State natural consequences or 
boundaries:
✓ "If this continues, I'll need to..."
✓ "To maintain our trust, I need..."
✓ "For me to feel safe, I need..."

❌ "Your problem is..."
❌ "What's wrong with you is..."
❌ "The issue with you..."
❌ "You have a problem with..."

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Frames the person as fundamentally 
broken. Creates shame, not motivation 
to change.

SBIR REQUIREMENT:
Focus on specific behavior impact:
✓ "When [behavior] happens, the impact 
    on me/us/team is..."
✓ "The challenge I'm experiencing is..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

```
═══════════════════════════════
⚡ TIER 3 - POWER LANGUAGE

❌ "Relax"
❌ "Don't be so sensitive"
❌ "You're overreacting"
❌ "It's not a big deal"

WHY FORBIDDEN:
Invalidates their experience and 
emotions. Tells them their feelings 
are wrong, which escalates conflict.

SBIR REQUIREMENT:
Acknowledge impact even if unintended:
✓ "I can see this affected you..."
✓ "I understand this matters to you..."
✓ "I hear that this was significant..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

## 🎯 TIER 4: MASTER LEVEL (5 Cards)
*Used with: RED cards*
*Focus: Advanced precision and ownership*

### Forbidden Words Card #16
```
═══════════════════════════════
🎯 TIER 4 - MASTER LEVEL
CARD #16
───────────────────────────────
ADVANCED RESTRICTIONS:

❌ "I think..."
❌ "I believe..."
❌ "I feel like..."
❌ "It seems to me..."
❌ "In my opinion..."

WHY FORBIDDEN (MASTER LEVEL):
These soften statements unnecessarily. 
At Black Belt level, own your 
observations with confidence.

MASTER REQUIREMENT:
State observations directly:
✓ "I observed..."
✓ "The data shows..."
✓ "I experienced..."
✓ "The impact was..."
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #17
```
═══════════════════════════════
🎯 TIER 4 - MASTER LEVEL
CARD #17
───────────────────────────────
ADVANCED RESTRICTIONS:

❌ "Maybe..."
❌ "Possibly..."
❌ "Perhaps..."
❌ "Kind of..."
❌ "Sort of..."

WHY FORBIDDEN (MASTER LEVEL):
Hedging language undermines your 
message. High-stakes feedback requires 
clarity and conviction.

MASTER REQUIREMENT:
Commit to your observation:
✓ "When you missed the deadline..."
   (not "When you kind of missed...")
✓ "This created a €50K penalty..."
   (not "This maybe caused issues...")
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #18
```
═══════════════════════════════
🎯 TIER 4 - MASTER LEVEL
CARD #18
───────────────────────────────
ADVANCED RESTRICTIONS:

❌ "Sorry, but..."
❌ "I don't mean to..."
❌ "No offense, but..."
❌ "I hate to say this..."
❌ "Don't take this the wrong way..."

WHY FORBIDDEN (MASTER LEVEL):
Pre-apologizing for feedback weakens 
it and signals you don't trust its 
validity. Stand behind your feedback.

MASTER REQUIREMENT:
Deliver feedback cleanly:
✓ Start directly with Situation
✓ Trust the SBIR framework
✓ No apologizing for legitimate 
   observations
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #19
```
═══════════════════════════════
🎯 TIER 4 - MASTER LEVEL
CARD #19
───────────────────────────────
ADVANCED RESTRICTIONS:

❌ "Just"
❌ "Simply"
❌ "Basically"
❌ "Essentially"
❌ "Actually"

WHY FORBIDDEN (MASTER LEVEL):
These minimize your message or sound 
condescending. "Just do X" implies 
it's trivial.

MASTER REQUIREMENT:
Use clean, direct language:
✓ "When you deleted the code..."
   (not "When you basically deleted...")
✓ "I need you to disclose the breach..."
   (not "I just need you to simply...")
═══════════════════════════════
```

### Forbidden Words Card #20
```
═══════════════════════════════
🎯 TIER 4 - MASTER LEVEL
CARD #20
───────────────────────────────
ADVANCED RESTRICTIONS:

❌ ANY pronoun ambiguity
❌ ANY missing timeline
❌ ANY unquantified impact
❌ ANY vague request
❌ ANY emotional language

WHY FORBIDDEN (MASTER LEVEL):
Black Belt feedback in high-stakes 
situations requires surgical precision. 
Every element must be verifiable.

MASTER REQUIREMENT:
✓ Names, dates, times, amounts
✓ Documented behavior only
✓ Measurable impact with numbers
✓ Specific, actionable request
✓ Professional tone throughout

EXAMPLE:
"On November 15th at 2pm, during the 
board meeting, you stated our runway 
was 6 months. Our financial statements 
show 2 months. This creates legal 
liability and damages trust with 
investors. I need you to send a 
corrected statement to the board by 
Friday at 5pm."
═══════════════════════════════
```
