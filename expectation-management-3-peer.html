      <h2>↔️ The Challenge of Horizontal Alignment</h2>
      <p>Managing expectations with peers and cross-functional partners is fundamentally different from managing up or down. You have no formal authority—you can't demand compliance or override decisions. Success depends on influence, negotiation, and building genuine partnership.</p>

      <p>Cross-functional work is where most organizational friction occurs. Different teams have different priorities, different definitions of success, and different pressures from their own leadership. What seems obvious to you may seem unreasonable to them. What they're asking for may feel like overreach to you.</p>

      <p>The key shift: stop thinking about "getting what you need" and start thinking about "finding solutions that work for everyone." Peer relationships are long-term games—winning today's battle while damaging the relationship makes every future interaction harder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>⚠️ Common Cross-Functional Challenges</h2>
      <p>Understanding typical friction points helps you anticipate and prevent them. Most cross-functional conflicts stem from a few predictable sources.</p>

      <div class="challenge-grid">
        <div class="challenge-box">
          <h4>Priority Conflicts</h4>
          <p>Their urgent request is your team's low priority—or vice versa. Both teams feel the other doesn't understand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-box">
          <h4>Scope Ambiguity</h4>
          <p>Who owns what? Gaps where no one takes responsibility, or overlaps where multiple teams are doing the same thing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-box">
          <h4>Timeline Mismatches</h4>
          <p>Their deadline doesn't match your capacity. Promised dates that can't be met.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-box">
          <h4>Communication Gaps</h4>
          <p>Assumptions that aren't explicit. Changes that don't get communicated. Surprises that could have been prevented.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Most of these challenges share a root cause: insufficient explicit expectation-setting at the start. The time invested upfront to align on expectations saves multiples of that time in rework, conflict resolution, and damaged relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>🤝 The Partnership Approach</h2>
      <p>The most effective cross-functional collaborators approach every interaction as building a partnership, not executing a transaction. They invest in understanding the other team's context, constraints, and goals—not just getting their immediate needs met.</p>

      <div class="framework-box">
        <h4>Partnership Mindset Principles</h4>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>The Relationship Bank Account</h3>
        <p>Every interaction with a peer either deposits into or withdraws from your relationship "bank account." Deposits: being helpful, meeting commitments, communicating proactively, giving credit. Withdrawals: missing deadlines, surprising them, blaming, taking credit. Keep your balance positive—you'll need it when you have a difficult ask.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>📋 Explicit Expectation-Setting</h2>
      <p>With peers, nothing should be assumed. The absence of formal authority means you need explicit agreements about who does what, when, and how success is measured. These agreements should be documented and revisited.</p>

      <p>Key areas to align on upfront:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope boundaries:</strong> What's in your remit vs. theirs? Where are the overlaps and handoffs?</li>
        <li><strong>Decision rights:</strong> Who makes which decisions? What requires joint agreement vs. individual calls?</li>
        <li><strong>Communication protocols:</strong> How will you stay aligned? What cadence? What channels?</li>
        <li><strong>Escalation paths:</strong> When things get stuck, how do you resolve? When do you escalate?</li>
        <li><strong>Success metrics:</strong> How will you both know this collaboration worked?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="script-box">
        <h4>Alignment Conversation Starter</h4>
        <p>"Before we dive into the project, I want to make sure we're aligned on how we'll work together. Can we take 15 minutes to clarify scope, decision-making, and communication? I find that explicit alignment upfront prevents a lot of friction later."</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>🔄 Managing Through Disagreement</h2>
      <p>Even with perfect upfront alignment, disagreements will arise. Different teams genuinely see the world differently. The skill is navigating these disagreements productively—finding solutions that work, preserving relationships, and keeping the broader goal in view.</p>

      <div class="solution-box">
        <h4>Step 1: Understand Their Constraint</h4>
        <p>Before pushing back, genuinely understand what's driving their position. "Help me understand what's behind this timeline—what are you optimizing for?" Often the constraint isn't what you assumed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution-box">
        <h4>Step 2: Share Your Constraint</h4>
        <p>Explain your situation with equal transparency. "Here's what I'm dealing with on my end..." Frame it as a shared problem to solve, not competing interests.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution-box">
        <h4>Step 3: Explore Creative Options</h4>
        <p>With both constraints on the table, brainstorm alternatives. "Given what we're both facing, what could work for both of us?" Often there's a third option neither of you considered initially.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution-box">
        <h4>Step 4: Escalate When Stuck</h4>
        <p>If you genuinely can't find a solution, escalate jointly—not adversarially. "We've tried to work this out but we're stuck. Can we bring this to [shared manager] together to get guidance?"</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>Avoid the End-Run</h3>
        <p>Going around a peer to their manager (or yours) without telling them damages trust permanently. If you need to escalate, do it transparently: "I think we need to bring our managers in on this—are you okay with that, or should we try one more approach first?"</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>📅 Working Agreements and SLAs</h2>
      <p>For ongoing cross-functional relationships, formal working agreements or service level agreements (SLAs) create clear, measurable expectations that don't depend on individual relationships. These are especially valuable when team membership changes.</p>

      <p>Elements of a good working agreement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Services provided:</strong> Exactly what each team commits to deliver to the other</li>
        <li><strong>Request process:</strong> How to submit requests, what information is needed, expected turnaround</li>
        <li><strong>Priority framework:</strong> How urgent requests are handled, what qualifies as urgent</li>
        <li><strong>Communication standards:</strong> Regular sync meetings, status update format, escalation contacts</li>
        <li><strong>Review cadence:</strong> When you'll revisit and update the agreement</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Working agreements aren't bureaucracy—they're clarity. They prevent the same expectation conversations from happening over and over. They create predictability that both teams can plan around.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>🌐 Building Your Cross-Functional Network</h2>
      <p>The best cross-functional collaborators don't just manage specific projects—they build a network of relationships across the organization. These relationships create shortcuts when you need help, provide early warning of changes that might affect you, and make collaboration smoother even before specific projects begin.</p>

      <p>Relationship-building tactics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular informal touchpoints:</strong> Coffee chats, lunch connections—not just meeting when you need something</li>
        <li><strong>Offer help proactively:</strong> "Is there anything my team can help with?" builds goodwill for future asks</li>
        <li><strong>Share information generously:</strong> Let partners know about things that might affect them before they ask</li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledge their wins:</strong> A quick Slack message celebrating their team's achievement costs nothing and means a lot</li>
        <li><strong>Debrief after projects:</strong> What worked in the collaboration? What could we do better next time?</li>
      </ul>
