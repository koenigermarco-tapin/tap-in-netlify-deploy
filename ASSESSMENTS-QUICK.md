# TAP-IN Quick Assessments

## 1. Mental Wellness Baseline

**Duration:** 3 minutes  
**XP Reward:** 100  
**Description:** A quick check-in on your current mental health, stress levels, energy, and overall wellbeing.

**Questions:** (Scale 1-5: Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)

1. I feel energized and ready to tackle my day when I wake up
2. I'm sleeping well and waking up refreshed most mornings
3. My stress levels feel manageable right now
4. I have consistent energy throughout the day without major crashes
5. I feel mentally clear and focused during work
6. I'm able to disconnect from work stress in my personal time
7. I feel emotionally balanced and resilient this week
8. I'm taking care of my physical health (movement, nutrition, rest)

**Results Interpretation:**

- **Score 32-40 (High Wellness):** You're in a strong mental wellness zone. Your energy, sleep, and stress management are working well. Keep up your current practices and use this as your baseline. Focus on maintaining these habits and doubling down on what's working.

- **Score 20-31 (Medium Wellness):** You're functioning but showing signs of strain. Some areas need attention before they become bigger issues. Identify your lowest-scoring questions and create a 1-2 week action plan to address them. Consider scheduling recovery time and reassessing boundaries.

- **Score 8-19 (Low Wellness):** You're running on fumes. Immediate action needed. This isn't sustainable. Schedule a conversation with your manager or a trusted colleague about workload. Prioritize sleep, movement, and recovery this week. Consider professional support if this persists.

## 2. Work-Life Balance Assessment

**Duration:** 3 minutes  
**XP Reward:** 100  
**Description:** Evaluate how well you're integrating work and personal life, setting boundaries, and creating time for recovery.

**Questions:** (Scale 1-5: Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)

1. I have clear boundaries between my work time and personal time
2. I regularly take breaks during the workday to recharge
3. I feel comfortable saying "no" to requests that would overextend me
4. I have time each week for activities that energize me outside of work
5. I'm able to fully disconnect from work during evenings and weekends
6. My personal relationships are getting the attention they deserve
7. I make time for physical movement or exercise most weeks
8. I prioritize recovery and rest without feeling guilty about it

**Results Interpretation:**

- **Score 32-40 (Strong Balance):** You've built sustainable boundaries and integration between work and life. You understand that balance isn't 50/50 every day—it's about intentional choices and recovery cycles. Your challenge: help others on your team build this same foundation.

- **Score 20-31 (Moderate Balance):** You're aware of balance but struggle to protect it consistently. Work often bleeds into personal time, or you feel guilty about disconnecting. Focus on one boundary to strengthen this month. Start small: pick one evening to fully unplug, or block 30 minutes daily for non-work activities.

- **Score 8-19 (Poor Balance):** Work is consuming your life. You're in reactive mode with little control over your time. This pattern leads to burnout. Action steps: (1) Audit your calendar for this week—what can be delegated, declined, or shortened? (2) Block sacred personal time and treat it like a client meeting. (3) Have a direct conversation about workload sustainability.

## 3. Communication Style Assessment

**Duration:** 4 minutes  
**XP Reward:** 100  
**Description:** Discover your natural communication preferences and style—how you express ideas, process information, and connect with others.

**Questions:** (Scale 1-5: Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)

1. I prefer to get straight to the point in conversations without much small talk
2. I think out loud and often process ideas by talking them through with others
3. I prefer written communication (email, Slack) over verbal conversations when possible
4. I focus heavily on data, logic, and evidence when making my case
5. I'm comfortable with direct, candid feedback even if it might create tension
6. I prioritize maintaining harmony and positive relationships in conversations
7. I take time to carefully choose my words before speaking in meetings
8. I express enthusiasm and emotion openly when communicating
9. I ask lots of questions to fully understand before forming opinions
10. I adapt my communication style based on who I'm talking to

**Results Interpretation:**

**Direct Communicator** (High scores on Q1, Q5, Q7):  
You value clarity, efficiency, and candor. You say what you mean and appreciate when others do the same. Strengths: Clear expectations, fast decisions, no confusion. Watch out for: Coming across as blunt or insensitive. Growth tip: Add context before delivering direct messages—explain the "why" to build buy-in.

**Diplomatic Communicator** (High scores on Q6, Q10, low on Q1, Q5):  
You prioritize relationships and harmony. You're skilled at reading the room and adapting your approach. Strengths: Build trust, navigate conflict smoothly, inclusive. Watch out for: Avoiding necessary tough conversations, being too indirect. Growth tip: Practice "caring candor"—you can be kind AND direct simultaneously.

**Analytical Communicator** (High scores on Q3, Q4, Q7, Q9):  
You lead with logic, data, and thorough analysis. You prepare carefully and value precision. Strengths: Well-reasoned arguments, credibility, minimizes errors. Watch out for: Over-analyzing, slowing decisions, missing emotional dynamics. Growth tip: Balance data with storytelling—numbers + narrative = influence.

**Expressive Communicator** (High scores on Q2, Q8, Q10):  
You're animated, enthusiastic, and process externally. You connect emotionally and inspire energy. Strengths: Engaging, builds momentum, makes ideas feel exciting. Watch out for: Dominating conversations, not listening enough, overwhelming introverts. Growth tip: Practice "think, pause, speak"—create space for others to contribute.

**Note:** Most people are a blend of styles. Your highest-scoring category is your default mode, especially under pressure. Self-aware communicators recognize their pattern and intentionally flex to match the situation and audience.
