## 🎯 OVERVIEW

### What Are SBIR Feedback Sparring Games?

A training methodology that combines:
- **Taboo-style word restrictions** (forces precision)
- **SBIR framework** (Situation, Behavior, Impact, Request)
- **Gamification** (points, voting, competition)
- **Peer accountability** (group catches forbidden words)

### Learning Objectives:

By the end of a session, participants will be able to:
- ✅ Deliver complete SBIR feedback under pressure
- ✅ Identify and avoid blame/vague/power language
- ✅ Transform awkward scenarios into constructive conversations
- ✅ Receive feedback without defensiveness
- ✅ Coach others on feedback delivery

### Belt System Alignment:

| Belt Level | Primary Focus | Game Variations | Forbidden Tier |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| White Belt | SBIR basics, vulnerability | SBIR Taboo | Tier 1 only |
| Blue Belt | Productive conflict | Speed Sparring, Partner Buy-In | Tier 1-2 |
| Purple Belt | Commitment through clarity | Escalation Ladder | Tier 1-3 |
| Brown Belt | Accountability conversations | Culture Clash, Reverse | Tier 1-4 |
| Black Belt | Teaching others | Gauntlet, facilitating | All tiers |

## 🎮 HOW TO PLAY: SBIR TABOO (Original Game)

### Game Overview:
Players take turns delivering SBIR feedback on scenario cards while avoiding forbidden words. Group votes on best delivery each round.

### Setup:
- **Players:** 2-6 (optimal: 4)
- **Duration:** 30-45 minutes (5-10 rounds)
- **Difficulty:** Beginner to Advanced
- **Tiers Used:** Start with Tier 1, add tiers as players improve

### Round Structure (5-7 minutes per round):

#### STEP 1: Draw Card (15 seconds)
- Player draws from color of their choice
- Reads scenario aloud to group
- Can ask clarifying questions
- **Decision point:** Attempt or abandon immediately?
  - If abandoned now: -1 point, no other consequence
  - If attempt fails later: -1 point + everyone sees it

#### STEP 2: Preparation (30-60 seconds)
- Silent preparation time
- Player plans their SBIR
- Can take notes
- Cannot discuss with others

**Facilitator Timer Options:**
- Beginner: 60 seconds
- Intermediate: 45 seconds
- Advanced: 30 seconds
- Expert: No prep time

#### STEP 3: Delivery (60-90 seconds)
- Player delivers complete SBIR out loud
- Must include all 4 elements (S-B-I-R)
- Group listens carefully for forbidden words

**Group's Role During Delivery:**
- Listen actively
- Track on fingers if forbidden words are used
- Do NOT interrupt until delivery is complete
- Note quality of each SBIR element

#### STEP 4: Violation Check (30 seconds)
- **Facilitator asks:** "Any forbidden words?"
- Group members raise hands if they caught violations
- Facilitator calls on one person at a time
- **Player who caught it must:**
  - Quote the exact forbidden word/phrase
  - Point to which tier it violates
  - Group votes: Was this actually a violation?
  
**Violation Confirmed:**
- Card goes to player's ABANDONED pile
- -1 point
- Player sits down
- Next player's turn

**No Violations (or all challenged successfully):**
- Card goes to DELIVERED pile
- Proceed to voting

#### STEP 5: Voting (30 seconds)
- Each player votes for best SBIR of the round (can't vote for self)
- **Voting methods:**
  - **Simultaneous:** On count of 3, everyone points at their choice
  - **Token:** Drop poker chip in front of person
  - **Written:** Write name on paper
- Ties split the votes
- Winner gets +0.5 per vote received

#### STEP 6: Score & Rotate (15 seconds)
- Players mark their score sheets
- Next player draws a card
- Repeat for 5-10 rounds

### Winning Conditions:

**Standard Game (5 rounds):**
- Highest total score wins
- Tiebreaker: Fewest abandoned cards
- Second tiebreaker: Most votes received

**Alternative Wins:**
- First to deliver 3 red cards successfully
- Highest score using only red/orange cards
- Most improved from previous session

## 🗳️ VOTING PROCEDURES

### What Are Players Voting For?

**Best SBIR Delivery**, evaluated on:
1. **Completeness:** All 4 elements present (S-B-I-R)
2. **Specificity:** Concrete details (dates, times, numbers)
3. **Impact Clarity:** Clear connection between behavior and consequence
4. **Request Quality:** Actionable and measurable
5. **Delivery:** Confident, not apologetic or aggressive

### Voting Methods:

#### Method 1: Simultaneous Point (Recommended)
**How:**
- Facilitator: "On 3, point to the best SBIR. 1... 2... 3!"
- Everyone points at once (can't vote for self)
- Facilitator counts quickly

**Pros:** Fast, prevents groupthink
**Cons:** Can be confusing with large groups

#### Method 2: Token Drop
**How:**
- Each player gets a poker chip/token
- Walks around and places it in front of their choice
- Can see who voted for whom

**Pros:** Clear, tactile, builds movement into game
**Cons:** Slower, requires tokens

#### Method 3: Written Ballot
**How:**
- Players write name on paper
- Fold and hand to facilitator
- Facilitator tallies and announces

**Pros:** Private, reduces social pressure
**Cons:** Slowest method

#### Method 4: Group Consensus (Small Groups Only)
**How:**
- Open discussion: "Whose SBIR was strongest?"
- Group agrees on winner
- Must reach consensus in 60 seconds or no one gets vote bonus

**Pros:** Creates discussion about quality
**Cons:** Can create conflict, time-consuming

### Voting Guidelines:

**DO Vote For:**
- ✅ Most complete and specific SBIR
- ✅ Clearest impact statement
- ✅ Most actionable request
- ✅ Best demonstration of mastery

**DON'T Vote For:**
- ❌ Your friend (unless they genuinely delivered best SBIR)
- ❌ The person who's behind in points (pity votes)
- ❌ Yourself (forbidden)
- ❌ The funniest delivery (unless also highest quality)

### Handling Ties:

**If 2 Players Tie for Votes:**
- Both get the points
- Example: 3 votes split evenly = both get 1.5 points

**If Everyone Gets Different Votes:**
- All get their respective vote totals
- Creates closer competition

**If No Clear Winner:**
- Facilitator breaks tie based on:
  1. Most specific Situation
  2. Most measurable Impact
  3. Most actionable Request

### Vote Coaching Moments:

**After Each Vote, Briefly Explain:**
"Sarah got the most votes because her Situation was specific - she said 'Tuesday at 2pm' not 'the other day.' Her Impact connected the behavior directly to missing the deadline. That's what we're aiming for."

This teaches the group what quality looks like.

## 🚫 ABANDONMENT PROCESS

### What is Abandonment?

A card is "abandoned" when:
1. **Pre-delivery:** Player chooses not to attempt after reading scenario
2. **During delivery:** Forbidden word is used and caught
3. **Post-delivery:** Group identifies violation after completion

### Pre-Delivery Abandonment:

**Process:**
1. Player draws card
2. Reads scenario aloud
3. Immediately says: "I'm abandoning this card"
4. Card goes to abandoned pile (-1 point)
5. Draw replacement? **Facilitator decides:**
   - **Lenient:** Draw replacement (max 1 replacement per round)
   - **Strict:** No replacement, lose your turn

**When to Allow:**
- Scenario too personal/triggering
- Player genuinely stuck
- Red card drawn too early in learning

**When to Discourage:**
- Player avoiding challenge
- Easy green/yellow cards
- Pattern of abandoning (not learning)

### During-Delivery Abandonment:

**Process:**
1. Player is mid-SBIR delivery
2. Observer hears forbidden word
3. **Observer raises hand immediately**
4. **Facilitator:** "Stop. What was the violation?"
5. Observer states the word and tier
6. **Facilitator:** "Group, is this a violation? Thumbs up/down"
7. Majority rules

**If Violation Confirmed:**
- Player stops immediately
- Card → abandoned pile
- -1 point, no votes possible
- Discussion: "How could you rephrase that?"
- Next player's turn

**If Challenge Rejected:**
- Player continues delivery
- No penalty to challenger
- Encourages careful listening

### Post-Delivery Abandonment:

**Process:**
1. Player completes full SBIR
2. **Facilitator:** "Any forbidden words?"
3. Observers raise hands
4. Facilitator calls on them one at a time
5. Must quote exact phrase
6. Group votes on whether it's a violation

**Gray Areas:**
- Word sounds like forbidden word but isn't
- Phrase is similar but not exact match
- Intent vs. literal interpretation

**Facilitator Decision:**
When in doubt, ask: "Did this violate the spirit of the tier restriction?"
- Tier 1: Did it attack character vs. describe behavior?
- Tier 2: Was it vague vs. specific?
- Tier 3: Did it remove agency vs. make a request?
- Tier 4: Was it hedging vs. confident?

### Recording Abandonments:

**On Score Sheet:**
- Mark card number
- Note which forbidden word was used
- Write tier violated

**Why Track This:**
- Identifies patterns (always violates Tier 2)
- Shows growth over time
- Informs coaching focus

### Abandonment Patterns to Watch:

**Red Flag: Player Abandons 50%+ of Cards**
- **Cause:** Not ready for this tier level
- **Solution:** Drop to lower tier or give extra prep time

**Red Flag: Only Red/Orange Cards Abandoned**
- **Cause:** Avoidance of difficult conversations
- **Solution:** Require attempting 1 hard card per session

**Red Flag: Same Violation Every Time**
- **Cause:** Habit not yet broken
- **Solution:** Focus training on that specific tier

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Players Too Nice to Catch Violations

**Symptoms:**
- Obvious forbidden words going unchallenged
- "I don't want to be mean..."
- Players letting friends slide

**Solutions:**
1. **Reframe:** "Catching violations IS being nice - you're helping them improve"
2. **Incentivize:** Bonus point for person who catches most violations
3. **Facilitator catches:** First 2 rounds, call out every violation yourself to model
4. **Written tracking:** Players write down violations, all reveal simultaneously

---

### Problem: Arguments Over Whether Something is a Violation

**Symptoms:**
- Debates lasting 5+ minutes
- "That's not what I meant!"
- Group split on interpretation

**Solutions:**
1. **Facilitator final call:** "I hear both sides. My ruling is [X]. Here's why: [principle]."
2. **Spirit vs. letter:** "Did this violate the SPIRIT of Tier X, even if not the exact word?"
3. **When in doubt, violation:** Encourages precision
4. **Vote:** Group thumbs up/down, majority rules in 10 seconds

**Facilitator Script:**
"I appreciate both perspectives. The principle behind Tier X is [principle]. In this case, [phrase] did/didn't violate that because [reason]. Let's move forward."

---

### Problem: One Player Dominating (Winning Every Round)

**Symptoms:**
- Same person gets all votes
- Other players getting discouraged
- Learning gap too wide

**Solutions:**
1. **Pair strong with weak:** Team scoring
2. **Handicap:** Strong player must use Tier 4, others use Tier 2
3. **Teaching role:** "You've mastered this. Coach the person to your left."
4. **Advanced challenges:** Give them only red cards
5. **Celebrate specific improvements:** "Sarah, you didn't win but your Impact statement was 10x better than last week!"

---

### Problem: Player Shuts Down After Abandoning Card

**Symptoms:**
- Visible embarrassment
- Withdrawn from group
- Stops trying on subsequent rounds

**Solutions:**
1. **Normalize immediately:** "Everyone abandons cards. I've abandoned 100+. It means you're pushing your edge."
2. **Share your failures:** Facilitator tells story of their own abandoned card
3. **Reframe:** "You just identified a growth edge. That's valuable data."
4. **Quick success:** Give them an easier card next round to rebuild confidence
5. **Private check-in:** "You good? That was a tough scenario."

**Facilitator Script:**
"Hey, that was a hard card. The fact that you attempted it shows courage. The forbidden word you used - 'you always' - that's the #1 violation for everyone learning this. You're in good company. Let's get you a win next round."

---

### Problem: Scenarios Too Easy/Hard for Group Level

**Symptoms:**
- All green cards delivered flawlessly
- OR all red cards abandoned
- No productive struggle

**Solutions:**
1. **Adjust card selection:** Remove green cards, use only orange/red
2. **Increase tier restriction:** Move from Tier 2 to Tier 3
3. **Decrease tier restriction:** Move from Tier 3 to Tier 2
4. **Add constraints:** "Deliver in 45 seconds instead of 90"
5. **Create custom scenarios:** Use real situations from participants

---

### Problem: Group Not Taking It Seriously (Too Much Joking)

**Symptoms:**
- Constant laughter
- Not listening to deliveries
- Treating it like pure entertainment

**Solutions:**
1. **Pause and reframe:** "Humor is great AND we're here to build a real skill. Let's focus."
2. **Share stakes:** "This skill determines whether your team trusts you in conflict."
3. **Real scenario:** "Let's do one round with a scenario someone actually faced this week."
4. **Consequence:** "If we don't take this seriously, we won't run it again."

**Facilitator Script:**
"I love the energy and the laughter - that means you feel safe. AND the whole point of this is to prepare for conversations that matter. Let's bring that energy with focus. Next round, I want to see your best work."

---

### Problem: Time Running Over Constantly

**Symptoms:**
- Sessions going 90+ minutes
- Only completing 3 rounds
- Rushed debrief

**Solutions:**
1. **Cut prep time:** 30 seconds max
2. **Enforce time limits strictly:** Timer visible, buzzer when time's up
3. **Fewer rounds, higher quality:** 3 excellent rounds > 7 rushed rounds
4. **Skip voting discussion:** Just vote, don't explain
5. **Streamline violation checks:** 15 seconds max

---

### Problem: Someone Brings Up Real Grievance Against Another Player

**Symptoms:**
- "Actually, [person in room], you DO interrupt me..."
- Tension in room
- Scenario card becomes real confrontation

**Solutions:**
1. **Pause immediately:** "Hold on. This feels like it shifted from practice to real."
2. **Honor the courage:** "It takes guts to raise a real issue. AND this isn't the right forum."
3. **Offer alternative:** "I'd like you two to have this conversation after, and I'm happy to facilitate if helpful."
4. **Reframe learning:** "This shows how powerful SBIR is - it surfaces real issues. Let's keep practicing on scenarios today."

**Facilitator Script:**
"I'm going to pause us here. It sounds like there's a real conversation that needs to happen between you two. That's actually great - it means this work is resonating. Let's not do it in front of the group right now. After the session, I'll make space for you both if you want. For now, let's stick with the scenario cards."

- [ ] **Enforce timing** - keeping structure creates safety
- [ ] **Stay neutral on content** - don't take sides on violations
- [ ] **Manage dominant personalities** - ensure everyone gets airtime

### During Debrief:

- [ ] **Ask open questions** - "What did you notice?" not "Did you learn X?"
- [ ] **Let silence happen** - don't fill every gap
- [ ] **Connect to real stakes** - "Where does this matter in your life?"
- [ ] **Get commitments** - "What will you do this week?"
- [ ] **End on inspiration** - "This skill changes relationships."

### After the Session:

- [ ] **Personal check-ins** - catch anyone who struggled
- [ ] **Collect score sheets** - track progress over time
- [ ] **Send follow-up** - resources, practice prompts, next session
- [ ] **Reflect on what worked** - adjust for next time
- [ ] **Celebrate wins** - email highlights to participants

### Your Energy Sets the Tone:

**High Energy = High Engagement**
- Your excitement is contagious
- If you're bored, they'll be bored
- If you believe this matters, they will too

**Calm Authority = Psychological Safety**
- You're the steady presence when things get awkward
- You model receiving feedback gracefully
- You normalize failure as part of learning

**Genuine Curiosity = Deep Learning**
- Ask "Why do you think that happened?" not "Here's what happened"
- Explore their insights before offering yours
- Treat them as co-discoverers, not students

### The Facilitator's Oath:

*"I will create a space where people can practice difficult conversations safely. I will enforce boundaries that build trust. I will celebrate courage over perfection. I will remind them why this matters. I will hold them accountable to growth. I will model the vulnerability I'm asking them to practice."*
