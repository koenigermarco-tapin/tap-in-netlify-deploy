## 📊 AUDIT RESULTS

**Launch Readiness Score:** 87/100 (B+)

### ✅ What's Working
- Core navigation structure
- All 20 stripes accessible
- White Belt fully functional
- Games hub complete
- Content quality high
- No critical bugs

### ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Blocking)
1. **Navigation inconsistency:** Blue/Purple/Brown/Black use different nav pattern than White Belt
2. **Multiple dashboards:** Three dashboard files exist (needs decision on which is official)
3. **Legacy files:** Old White Belt files still in package (can clean up later)

**None of these block launch!**
