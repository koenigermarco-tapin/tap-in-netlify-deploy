# 🚀 LINKEDIN LAUNCH POST

## Option 1: Bold & Direct

```
🎮 I just built 4 multiplayer games to help teams practice the hardest parts of leadership.

Most leadership training is boring lectures and role-plays.

So I created games that are actually fun:

🃏 Confession Poker → Practice vulnerability
💼 Conflict Cards → Navigate workplace conflicts  
🔥 Take the Back → Claim ownership under pressure
🎯 Disagree & Commit → Make hard decisions together

All free. All mobile-friendly. All ready to play right now.

Works on a single device (pass-and-play) or multiple devices (room codes).

Perfect for:
→ Team offsites
→ Leadership workshops  
→ 1-on-1 coaching
→ Remote team building

Try one with your team this week:
[INSERT GAME LINKS]

Built with React + Firebase. Took [X] weeks to ship.

What should I add next? 👇
```

**Why this works:** 
- Clear problem/solution
- Specific value props
- Low barrier (free, easy)
- Call to action

---

## Option 2: Story-Driven

```
"Your team needs to practice giving feedback."

I've said this to hundreds of leaders.

And they all say the same thing:

"We did feedback training last year. It didn't stick."

That's because traditional training SUCKS at creating lasting behavior change.

So I tried something different.

I built 4 multiplayer games that make practicing feedback actually FUN:

🃏 Confession Poker
Players rate their own honesty about workplace confessions.
Others guess their rating.
Builds psychological safety through vulnerability.

💼 Conflict Cards Against Humanity  
Cards Against Humanity format, but for workplace conflicts.
Makes difficult conversations feel less scary.

🔥 Take the Back
First person to claim ownership of a "broken thing" must explain how they'll fix it.
Group votes if it's convincing.
Accountability becomes a competition.

🎯 Disagree & Commit Roulette
Debate controversial business decisions under time pressure.
Must reach consensus or burn a block token.
Practice making hard calls together.

All 4 games are:
✅ Free to play
✅ Mobile-friendly
✅ Work remote or in-person
✅ Take 20-40 minutes

I've spent [X] weeks building these.

Now I want YOUR team to break them.

Play one this week and tell me what sucks:

P.S. If you're an L&D leader and want to use these in your programs, DM me. I'm building a facilitator toolkit.
```

**Why this works:**
- Relatable problem
- Emotional hook
- Shows not tells
- Invitation for feedback

```

**Recording tips:**

- Keep it under 30 seconds
- Add captions (most watch muted)

## Hashtag Strategy

**Must include:**
- #Leadership
- #TeamBuilding  
- #LearningAndDevelopment

**Good to add:**
- #PsychologicalSafety
- #Feedback
- #Conflict
- #Accountability
- #RemoteWork
- #WorkshopFacilitation

**Avoid:**
- Too many hashtags (looks spammy)
- Irrelevant trending tags
- #FollowBack type tags

---

## Engagement Tactics

**First Hour:**
- Respond to every comment quickly
- Tag people who might find it valuable
- Share in relevant LinkedIn groups
- Ask 5 friends to comment/share

**First Day:**
- Post updates if people share wins
- Answer questions publicly (creates social proof)
- Screenshot positive feedback, share as comment

**First Week:**
- Write follow-up post with stats ("50 teams played this week!")
- Share testimonials
- Post lessons learned

---

## Who to Tag (If Relevant)

- Tap-In company page
- Co-creators/collaborators  
- Beta testers who loved it
- Thought leaders in L&D space
- Companies you built it for

**Don't:**
- Tag random influencers (looks desperate)
- Tag more than 3-5 people (clutters post)

---

## Timing Tips

**Best times to post:**
- Tuesday-Thursday (highest engagement)
- 7-9am (catch morning scrollers)
- 12-1pm (lunch break)
- 5-6pm (end of workday)

**Avoid:**
- Monday mornings (people catching up)
- Friday afternoons (weekend mode)
- Weekends (B2B audience less active)

---
