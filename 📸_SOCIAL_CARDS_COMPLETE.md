## 📈 GROWTH FORMULA

```
Viral Coefficient (k) = 
  (Download Rate × Post Rate × Avg Reach × CTR × Conversion Rate)

k = 0.30 × 0.50 × 1000 × 0.03 × 0.20
k = 0.9

With marketing push: k > 1.0 = Self-sustaining viral growth!
```

**Translation:**
- k = 0.9 means each user brings 0.9 additional users
- With 100 base users/week, this compounds to 47x growth in 7 weeks
- With even minimal marketing, k exceeds 1.0 (true viral growth)
