#### Phase 4: Swap (5 min)

**🏦 Corporate Banking Context:**
"I'd like to discuss the December 3rd deliverable. The submission was received on December 10th, which created a 7-day delay in the compliance review process and put us at risk of regulatory penalties. Going forward, I need you to escalate potential delays 48 hours in advance so we can adjust timelines appropriately."

**🇯🇵 Japanese Context:**
"Thank you for your hard work on the project. I wanted to share some observations. Regarding the Friday deadline, the delivery timing created some challenges for the team's workflow. Perhaps we could consider implementing a checkpoint system to support our collaboration? I would value your thoughts on this."

- **Real examples:** Share stories of cross-cultural feedback failures/successes

### Debrief Focus:
- "Which context was hardest for you? Why?"
- "Where do you risk being too indirect? Too harsh?"

## 🏗️ GAME 9: THE TRUST TOWER

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert  
**Players:** 4-6  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Belt Level:** Purple Belt+  
**Primary Focus:** Building trust through vulnerability

### Overview:
Players move from low-vulnerability (easy) scenarios to high-vulnerability (personal) scenarios. Each successful delivery "builds" trust, unlocking harder conversations.

### Setup:
- Scenario cards organized by vulnerability level
- Physical blocks/Jenga pieces (represents trust)
- Tier 1-3 Forbidden Words
- Intimate setting (this gets real)

### The Trust Tower Levels:

#### LEVEL 1: Foundation (Green Cards)
**Low Vulnerability** - Impersonal scenarios
- Office annoyances
- Neighbor conflicts
- Service issues
- Must successfully deliver 3 Green cards
- Each success = add 1 block to tower

#### LEVEL 2: Structure (Yellow Cards)
**Medium Vulnerability** - Work relationships
- Colleague conflicts
- Professional boundaries
- Team dynamics
- Must successfully deliver 2 Yellow cards
- Each success = add 2 blocks to tower

#### LEVEL 3: Framework (Orange Cards)
**High Vulnerability** - Personal relationships
- Family dynamics
- Close friendships
- Partnership issues
- Must successfully deliver 2 Orange cards
- Each success = add 3 blocks to tower

#### LEVEL 4: Peak (Red Cards + Real Scenarios)
**Extreme Vulnerability** - Truth-telling
- Real feedback to someone in the room
- OR extremely difficult Red card scenario
- Must deliver 1 successfully
- Success = add 5 blocks (tower should be 20+ blocks high)

### Round Structure:

**Individual Turn (15 minutes):**

1. **Choose level** (2 min)
   - Can attempt any unlocked level
   - Higher risk = higher reward
   - Discuss with group which level to try

2. **Prepare vulnerability** (5 min)
   - For Levels 1-3: Draw scenario card
   - For Level 4: Prepare real feedback OR hardest Red card
   - Group provides support: "You've got this"

3. **Deliver with authenticity** (5 min)
   - Deliver SBIR fully
   - Group provides feedback
   - **Vote:** Was this vulnerable and authentic?
   - Must be unanimous "yes" to add blocks

4. **Reflect** (3 min)
   - "What did that feel like?"
   - "What made you choose that level?"
   - "What are you avoiding?"

### Special Mechanics:

**Trust Collapse:**
- If forbidden word used: Remove 3 blocks from tower
- If delivery felt inauthentic: Remove 2 blocks
- If group senses avoidance: Remove 1 block
- If tower falls: Game ends, restart from Level 1

**Trust Acceleration:**
- If Level 4 real feedback delivered: Double all blocks
- If someone delivers feedback they've been avoiding for months: +10 blocks
- If entire group reaches Level 4: Victory condition met

### Scoring:
- Group score (collaborative, not competitive)
- Goal: Build tower to 25 blocks without collapse
- Represents: "Our collective trust is strong enough for hard conversations"

### Winning Condition:
**Victory:** Tower reaches 25 blocks with all players contributing

**Bonus Victory:** All players deliver Level 4 real feedback to each other

### Special Rules:
- **Can support but not save:** Group can encourage, but can't deliver for someone
- **Voluntary vulnerability:** No one forced to Level 4
- **Psychological safety paramount:** Facilitator can veto if getting unsafe
- **Debrief after each Level 4:** Process emotions before continuing

### Best For:
- Teams building vulnerability-based trust (White Belt focus)
- Long-term cohorts (not one-time workshops)
- Leadership teams ready for real feedback
- Purple Belt: Commitment requires trust

### Facilitator Tips:
- **Go slow:** This isn't a race
- **Watch for performance vulnerability:** Looking vulnerable ≠ being vulnerable
- **Create safety first:** Don't pressure Level 4 if group isn't ready
- **Be ready for tears:** Real vulnerability brings real emotion
- **Have a plan for conflict:** Level 4 can surface real issues

### Debrief Focus:
- "What allowed you to be vulnerable here?"
- "What blocks you from this level of honesty in your daily life?"
- "How did it feel to receive Level 4 feedback?"
- "What changes if your team operates at this level of truth?"

### Warning:
**This game is intense.** Only facilitate if:
- Group has established safety
- You're prepared to handle real emotions
- Time is protected (can't rush this)
- Follow-up support is available
